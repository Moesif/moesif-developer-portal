# Moesif Developer Portal

The Moesif developer portal is an open-source project to help provide a great starting place to quickly build your own developer experience. You can customize and deploy the developer portal without being worried about lock-in or lack of customization. The developer portal is focused on providing a low-friction solution allowing your customers to quickly and easily subscribe and provide authenticated, metered access to your APIs.

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Moesif/moesif-developer-portal/wiki) for a comprehensive overview and step-by-step setup guide.

The `my-dev-portal` folder is a React application that contains the UI and front-end logic for the developer portal. Any additions to the UI, styling or branding changes, and other user-facing changes will be done within this folder/project.
